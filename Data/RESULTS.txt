## Data Folder Contents

The `Data` folder stores all result files generated by the tool, ensuring every detail about your OSINT investigations is logged and accessible. Typical files include:

- **email_information.json:** Stores details collected during email intelligence—breach data, registration status, and social media presence.
- **google_search_result.json:** Contains results from Google searches (phone numbers, usernames, etc.).
- **Instagram_information.json:** Details about Instagram registration/status for numbers or emails checked.
- **Phone_validation.json:** Logs results of phone number validation and provider checks.
- **WhatsApp_information.json:** Records whether a phone number is registered on WhatsApp.

Each file is in JSON format, making it easy to parse and utilize for further analysis or reporting.

## How Results Are Generated

- For each search or check performed with DIGI-NETRA, the relevant information is stored in the corresponding file in the `Data` folder.
- This approach ensures that every investigation is documented, and results can be revisited or shared as needed.
